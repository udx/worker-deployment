## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
- Adjusted environment variable settings and volume mounts for GCP authentication

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced - Full Terraform/SDK Support for Impersonation

### Changed
- **Service Account Impersonation** - Now fully compatible with Terraform, SDKs, gcloud CLI, and all Google Cloud client libraries
  - Uses user's Application Default Credentials (ADC) as source for impersonation
  - Generates proper `impersonated_service_account` credential file (official Google format)
  - Sets both `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (for Terraform/SDKs) and `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` (for gcloud)
  - Dual authentication ensures all tools work seamlessly
  - Eliminates the need for service account key files even when using Terraform

### Added
- **ADC Integration** - Automatically uses `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
- **Fallback Support** - Falls back to access token if ADC not configured
- **Setup Guidance** - Clear instructions for `gcloud auth application-default login`

### Technical Details
- Creates `impersonated_service_account` type credential file using user's ADC as source
- Mounts credential file as read-only in container
- Passes access token as environment variable for gcloud CLI compatibility
- Follows official Google Cloud authentication best practices
- Token remains valid for 1 hour
